            The Directed Reading Program (DRP) pairs undergraduate students 
            with graduate student mentors for semester-long independent study 
            projects. It runs each semester and during the summer and is 
            coordinated by math Ph.D. students. Participation is not for 
            credit and does not appear on a student's transcript.
